# 1. Architecture & Design Decisions (Rationale)

## 1.1 System Architecture (High-Level)
Fitiva is a full-stack web application with:
- **Frontend:** Next.js 16.1.6 (React 19.2.3, TypeScript 5.x) using **custom CSS** and **CSS variables** for theming (no Tailwind).
- **Backend:** Django 4.2.8 + Django REST Framework 3.14.0 with **session-based authentication** (Django sessions).
- **Database:** MySQL 8.0 (host port 3307 → container 3306) running via Docker Compose.
- **DevOps:** Docker Compose (frontend + backend + db), enabling consistent setup across Windows/Mac.

## 1.2 Repository Structure (Layered Organization)
We organized the codebase by layers and features, aligning with a clean separation of concerns.

### Frontend (Next.js) — `frontend/src/`
- **Routes & UI pages** (feature-based):
  - `/signup`, `/login`, `/dashboard`, `/profile/[id]`, `/create-program`, `/trainer-programs`
- **Global providers / cross-cutting concerns:**
  - `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` → global authentication state and persistence
  - `components/ThemeProvider.tsx` → theme initialization (light/dark)
- **API client layer:**
  - `library/api.ts` → typed API functions (`authAPI`, `profileAPI`) + error handling
- **Reusable UI components:**
  - `components/ui/*` → Button/Input/Alert/Logo/Modals/Theme toggle components
- **Styling approach:**
  - One `.css` file per page/component plus `globals.css` for theme variables.

### Backend (Django) — `backend/api/`
- **Domain models:** `models.py`  
  Includes `CustomUser`, `UserProfile`, `TrainerProfile`, and workout program structure:
  `WorkoutPlan` → `ProgramSection` → `Exercise` → `ExerciseSet`, plus `ExerciseTemplate`.
- **Serialization layer:** `serializers.py`  
  Uses nested serializers for structured program creation (sections → exercises → sets).
- **HTTP/API layer:** `views.py` + `urls.py`  
  Implements endpoints for auth, profile CRUD, programs CRUD, and exercise template listing/search.
- **Automated tests:** `tests.py`  
  Covers authentication and profile operations for iteration 1.

## 1.3 Major Design Decisions (and Why)

### Decision A — “Real DB + Seeded Data” instead of a fake ArrayList stub
Although the course description allows a stub database, Fitiva uses a **Dockerized MySQL database** from the start to reduce integration risk later and to enable nested program persistence (plans → sections → exercises → sets).
- Benefit: avoids rewriting persistence logic in ITR2 when moving from stub to real DB.
- Risk mitigation: development remains reproducible via Docker Compose; schema is managed by migrations.

### Decision B — Session-based authentication (Django sessions)
We implemented **session cookies** (not JWT) for simpler secure local development and consistent server-side auth state.
- Frontend requests include cookies (`credentials: 'include'`) from the API client (`frontend/src/library/api.ts`).
- Backend provides `/api/auth/signup`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/logout`, `/api/auth/me`.

### Decision C — Strong separation between UI state and backend data
- Auth state is centralized in `AuthContext`, preventing duplicate auth logic in each page.
- Protected pages are gated via `ProtectedRoute` so that access control is consistent.
- API calls are centralized in `library/api.ts`, enforcing typed request/response shapes.

### Decision D — Program modeling matches the product UX (Monday–Sunday)
Trainer program creation is structured around a weekly grid:
- A program always includes **7 days** (Monday–Sunday) using `ProgramSection.format`.
- “Rest days” are explicit (`is_rest_day`) and validated with warnings if exercises exist.
- Exercise ordering is preserved using `order` fields and UI drag-and-drop.

This aligns backend structure with the frontend builder UI so that saving/loading is stable.

### Decision E — Theme system via CSS variables (full dark mode)
Fitiva supports **full dark mode** across the entire app using CSS variables in `globals.css` and a `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`.
- Theme preference persists in `localStorage`.
- Theme switching is available for logged-in users (SettingsModal) and non-logged-in users (ThemeToggle on login/signup).
- All UI components reference variables (no hardcoded colors), ensuring consistency.

### Decision F — Drag-and-drop reordering uses native HTML5 API
We implemented drag-and-drop reordering of exercises **within a day** using the native HTML5 drag-and-drop API.
- We restrict moves to the same day to keep behavior predictable and reduce complexity in ITR1.
- Handlers are defined at the component level (not nested) to avoid React re-render issues.

## 1.4 Domain Model Rationale (Backend)
Key domain objects and why they exist:
- **CustomUser** with `is_trainer`: single user table supports both roles.
- **UserProfile**: captures workout preferences; auto-created at signup with `age=null` to detect incomplete profile.
- **TrainerProfile**: captures trainer public info (bio, specialties, certifications).
- **WorkoutPlan**: the top-level program entity; supports multi-focus via array field and `is_deleted` for soft-delete planning.
- **ProgramSection**: a “day” within the plan; supports explicit rest days.
- **Exercise / ExerciseSet**: represent ordered exercises and set-level details (reps/time/rest).
- **ExerciseTemplate**: searchable library to speed up program authoring.
- **WorkoutSession / WorkoutFeedback**: created for future stories (completion tracking + post-workout feedback) and aligns with Big Stories 2 & 3.

# 3. Plan Revision (ITR0 → ITR1)
This section documents what changed from the **Iteration 0 plan** to the **Iteration 1 plan**, and why.

## 3.1 Original Plan (ITR0 Snapshot)
**ITR1 User Stories included:**
- US 1.1 Register & Log In
- US 1.2 Create Fitness Profile
- US 1.3 View Profile-Based Recommendations
- US 1.4 Browse Trainer-Created Programs
- US 1.5 Select Plan + Auto-Generate Weekly Schedule

## 3.2 Revised Plan (ITR1 Updated)
**Changes introduced in ITR1 planning update:**
- Added **US 1.3: Create Programs from list of workouts** (trainer program builder)
- Added **US 1.4: View List of Workouts** (catalog of workouts)
- Reordered/renamed some stories for clearer scope:
  - Recommendations moved to **US 1.6**
  - Plan selection + schedule becomes **US 1.7**
- Added dashboard scheduling enhancement:
  - **US 3.6: Personalized Schedule from Selected Program** (calendar-style schedule view)

## 3.3 Rationale for Plan Changes
- The team needed an explicit workflow for trainers to build programs (US 1.3) and for users to browse workouts before committing (US 1.4).
- The schedule/calendar experience (US 3.6) was introduced to make weekly planning visible and testable in the UI early.

*(Keep both planning docs in the repo, e.g., `/docs/ITR0-Plan.md` and `/docs/ITR1-Plan.md` or similar.)*
