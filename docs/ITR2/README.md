# 1. Architecture & Design Decisions (Rationale)

## 1.1 System Architecture (High-Level)
Fitiva is a full-stack web application with:
- **Frontend:** Next.js 16.1.6 (React 19.2.3, TypeScript 5.x) using **custom CSS** and **CSS variables** for theming (no Tailwind).
- **Backend:** Django 4.2.8 + Django REST Framework 3.14.0 with **session-based authentication** (Django sessions).
- **Database:** MySQL 8.0 (host port 3307 → container 3306) running via Docker Compose.
- **DevOps:** Docker Compose (frontend + backend + db), enabling consistent setup across Windows/Mac.

## 1.2 Repository Structure (Layered Organization)
We organized the codebase by layers and features, aligning with a clean separation of concerns.

### Frontend (Next.js) — `frontend/src/`
- **Routes & UI pages** (feature-based):
  - `/signup`, `/login`, `/dashboard`, `/profile/[id]`, `/create-program`, `/trainer-programs`
- **Global providers / cross-cutting concerns:**
  - `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` → global authentication state and persistence
  - `components/ThemeProvider.tsx` → theme initialization (light/dark)
- **API client layer:**
  - `library/api.ts` → typed API functions (`authAPI`, `profileAPI`, `sessionAPI`) + error handling
- **Reusable UI components:**
  - `components/ui/*` → Button/Input/Alert/Logo/Modals/Theme toggle components
- **Styling approach:**
  - One `.css` file per page/component plus `globals.css` for theme variables.

### Backend (Django) — `backend/api/`
- **Domain models:** `models.py`
  Includes `CustomUser`, `UserProfile`, `TrainerProfile`, and workout program structure:
  `WorkoutPlan` → `ProgramSection` → `Exercise` → `ExerciseSet`, plus `ExerciseTemplate`,
  `WorkoutSession`, and `WorkoutFeedback`.
- **Serialization layer:** `serializers.py`
  Uses nested serializers for structured program creation (sections → exercises → sets).
- **HTTP/API layer:** `views.py` + `urls.py`
  Implements endpoints for auth, profile CRUD, programs CRUD, exercise template listing/search,
  schedule management, workout completion, feedback, and trainer aggregated feedback.
- **Automated tests:** `backend/api/tests/` (9 test files — see Section 6).

## 1.3 Major Design Decisions (and Why)

### Decision A — "Real DB + Seeded Data" instead of a fake ArrayList stub
Although the course description allows a stub database, Fitiva uses a **Dockerized MySQL database** from the start to reduce integration risk later and to enable nested program persistence (plans → sections → exercises → sets).
- Benefit: avoids rewriting persistence logic when moving from stub to real DB.
- Risk mitigation: development remains reproducible via Docker Compose; schema is managed by migrations.

### Decision B — Session-based authentication (Django sessions)
We implemented **session cookies** (not JWT) for simpler secure local development and consistent server-side auth state.
- Frontend requests include cookies (`credentials: 'include'`) from the API client (`frontend/src/library/api.ts`).
- Backend provides `/api/auth/signup`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/logout`, `/api/auth/me`.

### Decision C — Strong separation between UI state and backend data
- Auth state is centralized in `AuthContext`, preventing duplicate auth logic in each page.
- Protected pages are gated via `ProtectedRoute` so that access control is consistent.
- API calls are centralized in `library/api.ts`, enforcing typed request/response shapes.
- Workout session and history calls are centralized in `sessionAPI.getWorkoutHistory()`.

### Decision D — Program modeling matches the product UX (Monday–Sunday)
Trainer program creation is structured around a weekly grid:
- A program always includes **7 days** (Monday–Sunday) using `ProgramSection.format`.
- "Rest days" are explicit (`is_rest_day`) and validated with warnings if exercises exist.
- Exercise ordering is preserved using `order` fields and UI drag-and-drop.

This aligns backend structure with the frontend builder UI so that saving/loading is stable.

### Decision E — Theme system via CSS variables (full dark mode)
Fitiva supports **full dark mode** across the entire app using CSS variables in `globals.css` and a `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`.
- Theme preference persists in `localStorage`.
- Theme switching is available for logged-in users (SettingsModal) and non-logged-in users (ThemeToggle on login/signup).
- All UI components reference variables (no hardcoded colors), ensuring consistency.

### Decision F — Drag-and-drop reordering uses native HTML5 API
We implemented drag-and-drop reordering of exercises **within a day** using the native HTML5 drag-and-drop API.
- We restrict moves to the same day to keep behavior predictable and reduce complexity.
- Handlers are defined at the component level (not nested) to avoid React re-render issues.

### Decision G — WorkoutFeedback stored per session date (ITR2)
Post-workout feedback is stored as a `WorkoutFeedback` model linked to a `WorkoutSession` by date.
- `GET/POST /api/sessions/feedback/<date>/` enables per-day feedback retrieval and submission.
- The schedule endpoints (`/api/schedule/active/` and `/api/schedule/workout/<date>/`) return a `has_feedback` boolean so the UI can show "Feedback Given" vs. "Rate this Workout" badges without a separate API call.
- Feedback auto-prompts after completing a workout; it is always skippable.

### Decision H — Schedule regeneration triggered manually and automatically (ITR2)
Weekly schedule regeneration (US 2.3) is triggered two ways:
- **Manual:** a user or trainer can explicitly regenerate the schedule.
- **Automatic:** the system regenerates on Sundays based on accumulated feedback.
This keeps the experience flexible and testable without requiring a live cron job in development.

## 1.4 Domain Model Rationale (Backend)
Key domain objects and why they exist:
- **CustomUser** with `is_trainer`: single user table supports both roles.
- **UserProfile**: captures workout preferences; auto-created at signup with `age=null` to detect incomplete profile.
- **TrainerProfile**: captures trainer public info (bio, specialties, certifications).
- **WorkoutPlan** (with `is_published`): the top-level program entity; `is_published` controls browsing visibility for users; supports multi-focus via array field and `is_deleted` for soft-delete planning.
- **ProgramSection**: a "day" within the plan; supports explicit rest days.
- **Exercise / ExerciseSet**: represent ordered exercises and set-level details (reps/time/rest).
- **ExerciseTemplate**: searchable library to speed up program authoring.
- **WorkoutSession**: records workout completion per date; includes `completed` and `in_progress` states.
- **WorkoutFeedback**: stores post-workout difficulty (1–5), fatigue flag, pain flag, and notes per session; used for regeneration logic and trainer aggregated dashboard.

# 3. Plan Revision (ITR1 → ITR2)
This section documents what changed from the **Iteration 1 plan** to the **Iteration 2 plan**, and why.

## 3.1 Baseline Plan (ITR1 Snapshot)
**Stories completed in ITR1:**
- US 1.1 Register & Log In
- US 1.2 Create Fitness Profile
- US 1.3 Create Programs from list of workouts (trainer program builder)
- US 1.4 View List of Workouts
- US 1.5 Browse Trainer-Created Programs
- US 1.6 Profile-Based Recommendations
- US 3.1 Record Workout Completion (model + UI completion state)
- US 3.6 Personalized Calendar Schedule View (weekly calendar layout)

## 3.2 Revised Plan (ITR2 Updated)
**New stories introduced in ITR2:**
- **US 2.1 – Submit Post-Workout Feedback:** difficulty scale (1–5), fatigue/pain flags, notes; auto-prompts after session completion.
- **US 2.3 – Automatic Weekly Schedule Regeneration:** integrates feedback into next-week schedule; supports manual trigger and Sunday auto-regeneration.
- **US 2.4 – Review Aggregated Client Feedback:** trainer-facing dashboard showing average difficulty, fatigue frequency, and weekly trends chart.
- **US 2.5 – Accept or Lock Recommended Adjustments:** confirmation modal + lock flag for trainer-approved schedule adjustments.
- **US 3.3 – Analyze Training Trends:** total workouts, total training time, current streak, empty state; weekly activity chart fixed to minutes.
- **US 3.4 – View Progress Summary Dashboard:** total workouts/week widget, total minutes/week widget, workout summary graph pulling from history and completed sessions.

**Notable ITR2 enhancements:**
- `is_published` field added to `WorkoutPlan` for trainer browsing visibility control.
- Edit and delete functionality added for workout programs.
- `sessionAPI.getWorkoutHistory()` introduced and used to centralize session data fetching on the dashboard.
- Dashboard widget layout bug fixed (widgets no longer shift when clicking Recommendations).
- `recharts` dependency properly resolved via Docker anonymous volume for `/app/node_modules`.

## 3.3 Rationale for Plan Changes
- Post-workout feedback (US 2.1) was needed to feed the regeneration engine (US 2.3) and the trainer feedback dashboard (US 2.4).
- Training trends (US 3.3) and the progress dashboard (US 3.4) were prioritized early in ITR2 to give users meaningful data visualization while workout history accumulates.
- US 2.5 (lock/accept adjustments) closes the feedback loop for trainers managing client schedules.

*(Planning docs are maintained at `/docs/ITR0/`, `/docs/ITR1/`, and `/docs/ITR2/`.)*

### Iteration 2 Reflection

**What Went Well**
- Clear separation between backend aggregation logic (US 2.1 backend unblocking US 2.4) and frontend dashboard rendering
- Strong test coverage: 9 dedicated test files covering all major domain areas
- Successful migration of feedback and session data to persistent DB storage
- Dashboard refactoring to `sessionAPI.getWorkoutHistory()` improved code consistency across US 3.3 and 3.4
- recharts integration worked smoothly for both feedback trends (US 2.4) and activity chart (US 3.3)

**What Can Be Improved**
- US 2.5 (Dawood) was not implemented and committed by the ITR2 deadline
- Some UI spacing and visual hierarchy refinements still needed on feedback modal
- Regeneration logic explanations for users could be clearer in the UI
- Time estimates for schedule test suite (US 2.3) were underestimated — test file grew to ~43 KB
- Meeting minutes for the ITR2 implementation period should be more detailed

---

Repo structure:

frontend/ — frontend container

frontend/src/ — frontend source code

backend/ — backend container

backend/api/ — backend source code

backend/api/tests/ — all test files (9 files)

docs/ — planning documents (ITR0, ITR1, ITR2)

GitHub Wiki — wiki + architecture sketch references

8. Concern / Challenge
US 2.5 not committed: Dawood's implementation of US 2.5 (Accept or Lock Recommended Adjustments) was not merged into the repository before the ITR2 branch was created. It was deferred to ITR3.

All other team members delivered their assigned stories with no concerns about group dynamics or project direction.

9. Next Steps (Preview for ITR3)
Confirm status of US 2.5 and either complete or reschedule it

Identify additional ITR3 stories

Plan improvements:

Expand test coverage for feedback and regeneration edge cases

UI polish: feedback modal spacing, dashboard visual hierarchy

Add rewards/reflection flows tied to streaks and milestones

Improve dashboard UI with richer visual elements

Add trainer-side client management views
